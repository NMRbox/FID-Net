FIDNet: Reconstructing 2D NUS Spectra
------------
------------
This code is for reconstructing 2D NUS NMR spectra using the FID-Net architecture.
To use the code, the file containing the weights for the trained network must be
downloaded. This is availble [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6qfaoae7n96mfuj/fidnet_recon.h5?dl=0).
Once downloaded the MODEL_WEIGHTS line in fidnet_recon.py must be changed to the
path to the weights file (fidnet_recon.h5).
